Imagine a modern twist on the beloved Tamagotchi of the 90s - introducing Teamagochi,  
**the ultimate fusion of nostalgia and cutting-edge technology**.
Our student term project aims to create a revolutionary IoT device equipped with a digital twin, granting it access to the vast realm of the internet.
Just like its inspirational predecessor, the Teamagochi will rely on its owners for care and interaction, but with the added dimension of online connectivity,
offering endless possibilities for learning, entertainment, and community experiences. Join us as we embark on a journey to redefine the boundaries of
virtual pet ownership in the digital age!
