keep track of time:

	(light sensor)
		=> more active during bright environments
	(proximity sensor)
		=> pet detects owner
			=> pet wakes up from sleep
			=> pet gets happy if already awake
		=> pet can be petted

track orientation:
	| gyro
	| accelerometer
	| (magnetometer)
	=> wake the pet up
	=> move pet when device is tilted
	=> pet moves when device is in motion
